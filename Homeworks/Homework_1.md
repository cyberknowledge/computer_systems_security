## Homework excersizes

1. Access the following links and explore information of Ransowmware Attacks, Data Breaches, and Hacks to gain a perspective of the current state in the cyber security field:

- [World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks] (https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/)
- [Ransomware Attacks] (https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/)
- [Shodan Examples] (https://www.shodan.io/search/examples)
- [Shodan Popular] (https://www.shodan.io/explore/popular)

2. Search for 2 of the most relevant cyber attacks (Kaseya, SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline) and provide a 2 paragraph summary of these attacks and respond to the following questions:

- Who was the threat actor?
- Are there proofs that the actor was state sponsored?
- What was the threat for the targeted company?
- What was the risk for the targeted company?

- What vulnerability was exploited?
- What was the attack vector?
- How could the victim could have mitigate the risk?
- What are the potential costs of this attack? (E.g., Ransom, shutdowns, price increase of a product, panic, stockmarket, crypto market)

3. Install Vagrant, Virtualbox (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux) and create a Virtual Machine with Kali Linux (See Tutorials_1)

4. Install a vulnerable application (WebGoat or DVWA) in your Kali Linux system

5. Use a reconnaisance/information gatehring tool (Recon-ng or Nmap) to identify open ports and running services in your system.

6. Use a vulnerability assessment tool (Nikto, OWASP ZAP, or SQLmap) to identify vulnerabilities in the target application (WebGoat or DVWA).

7. Present your observation of the information obtained in 5 (2 paragraphs)

8. Describe 5 vulnerabilities you found. 

9. Are you able to connect them to CVEs or CPEs? (Extra Points)
